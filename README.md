# Notes

I have created this repository for sharing some R-scripts that I have developed during my work as postdoctoral researcher at Aalborg University, in the project "Global flows of migrants and their impact on north European welfare states - FLOW".

It is not endorsed by the university or the project, and it is not maintained. My only aim is that the repository serves for learning R, for more information about migration and the project outcomes please visit the projectâ€™s website: https://www.flow.aau.dk.
